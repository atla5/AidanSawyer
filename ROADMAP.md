### Current Work and Objectives ###

I currently work as a **Web Developer** for the Boston University library system, 
formatively constructing the foundations of a more integrated systems approach to 
their digital systems and website management. 

In doing so, I've been investing heavily into technologies and methods to reclaim greater 
control and interoperability within and between our various vendor platforms via the use 
of Web Components and future integrations with serverless hosting, API coordination, and 
Linked Data. 

My larger goal is to gain a greater conceptual and practical understanding of the knowledge
infrastructure and the way in which our intellectual resources are generated, described, 
discovered, circulated, and maintained. It's my mission to positively affect this infrastructure,
and to assist in bringing about a more complete, semantic, and distributively cooperative
framework of knowledge production and dissemination. 


### Overarching Purpose ###

There is a **machine** of knowledge discovery, management, and preservation that
powers the intellectual pursuit and expansion of mankind and, in cascading
effect, his productive capacity for and overall output of value.

The **fuel** for this machine, in large part, is the mammoth amount of
information _created_ on a daily basis, _available_ in tremendous volume, and
_accessible_ at unprecedented ease.

I intend to spend my career improving this engine and refining this fuel by
working on the software used in and around its central institutions, and on the
tools and schemas with which their content is packaged and described, to the
ultimate goal of **accelerating human progress** exponentially.  

### Implementation ###

#### Immediate/Short-Term ####

Iâ€™m currently putting this goal into action by:

  1. Working directly in the library setting in the Boston University Libraries 'Web Systems'
     team as a Web Developer, building, coordinating, and maintaining 
     various information discovery and delivery systems. 
  2. Fostering the academic habits derived from my formal eduction into a focused and 
     strategic study to gain a better understanding of the technical and conceptual 
     intricacies and developments within the field past, present, and future.
  3. Investigating and implementing technologies that are increasingly semantic and 
     interoperable, and which promise to have a lasting and formative affect on the future.
  4. Discovering, developing, and maintaining the open source software infrastructure
     providing value for the daily operation and success of the field's core functions.

#### Medium-Term ####

Developing along the same trajectory, I plan to:

  1. Take graduate courses centering on Library and Information Sciences.
  2. Attend conferences, meetups, and webinars to further develop the community and 
     the help to influence the intellectual/practical space.
  3. Utilize technologies central to the field's progression and document their 
     usefulness and impact. 

#### Long-Term ####

Once I've established myself in the field and my career, I hope to be able to:

  1. Help devise, develop, integrate, and extend the known practices and
     theories to their ultimate end and to help direct and advise the progress
     of the field as a whole towards the area of greatest impact and clarity.
  2. Effectively implement these standards into optimally constructed and interoperable
     products that have profound impact on academic practice and the structure/nature 
     of the Web going forward.
  3. Formulate, encourage, and cultivate a thriving community of tools and APIs
     built around these products to facilitate their use and bring about their
     greatest possible collaborative effect in as wide a swath of human activity
     as possible.
