### Current Objective ###

I’m currently looking for a **6-12 month internship** in Software Engineering
from the period of January - December 2017 offering meaningful work involved
with the organization, preservation, and expansion of knowledge, with particular
regard to library, archive, museum, and publications (LAMP) resources and
scientific research.

### Overarching Purpose ###

There is a **machine** of knowledge discovery, management, and preservation that
powers the intellectual pursuit and expansion of mankind and, in cascading
effect, his productive capacity for and overall output of value.

The **fuel** for this machine, in large part, is the mammoth amount of
information _created_ on a daily basis, _available_ in tremendous volume, and
_accessible_ at unprecedented ease.

I intend to spend my career improving this engine and refining this fuel by
working on the software used in and around its central institutions, and on the
tools and schemas with which their content is packaged and described, to the
ultimate goal of **accelerating human progress** exponentially.  

### Implementation ###

#### Immediate ####

I’m currently putting this goal into action by:
1. pursuing an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering (from RIT),
2. working in the Digital Initiatives department of my university’s library (Wallace)
3. developing and maintaining Free and Open Source Software on github (atla5).

#### Short-Term ####

My short-term goals center on establishing a foundation of knowledge and
  experience to use as a basis for the start of my career. This manifests itself
  in three main paths:

  1. Completing my Bachelors of Science degree in Software Engineering at RIT.
  2. Gain technical expertise and domain knowledge by succeeding at internships
     in the various institutions of the knowledge production and management
     (LAMP) fields as well as the closely related facets involved with search,
      data-mining, and standards adherence/creation.
  3. Discovering, developing, and maintaining the open source software infrastructure
     providing value for the daily operation and success of the field's core functions.

#### Medium-Term ####

Developing along the same trifold trajectory, I plan to:

  1. Foster the training habits derived from my formal eduction into a
     focused and strategic study to gain a better understanding of the
     technical and conceptual intricacies and developments within the field.
  2. Obtain a long-standing position at a company that shares my purpose and
     provides me with the chance/s to dive deep into its main growth areas,
     attend conferences/webinars, and to utilize technologies central to its
     progression.
  3. Develop fully-supported and informed solutions that provide exceptional and
     accessible value to technical and non-technical LAMP works alike, and
     maintain these and other critical projects into the future, guiding them
     through important advancements without sacrificing backwards compatibility.

#### Long-Term ####

Once I've established myself in the field and my career, I hope to be able to:

  1. Help devise, develop, integrate, and extend the known practices and
     theories to their ultimate end and to help direct and advise the progress
     of the field as a whole towards the area of greatest impact and clarity.
  2. Effectively implement these standards into optimally constructed and
     powerful new products that have profound effect on the means and limits
     of the technologies and standards of those in the field today.
  3. Formulate, encourage, and cultivate a thriving community of tools and APIs
     built around these products to facilitate their use and bring about their
     greatest possible collaborative effect in as wide a swath of human activity
     as possible.
