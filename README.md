### Description ###

##### short #####
hold information about my education, work experience, projects, and goals.

##### long #####
This repository is meant to act as both:
 - a convenient reference for visitors to my page to better understand my background and
 - a central hub to store the data objects about my personal and professional
   career in one location.

### Content ###

As a "resume", the repository is meant to store information relevant to my work
  and career. Following the traditional divisions as well as those I found most
  desirable to my site, the information is stored as follows:

|file|description|
|:--|:---------------|
|ROADMAP.md|textual description of stated goals, plans, and objectives over time.|
|experience.json|JSON objects storing information about my work experience and what it's taught me|
|education.json|JSON objects storing information about my college and high school|
|projects.json|JSON objects storing information about my open-source involvement|
|additional.json|JSON listing of languages, skills, interests, and links that didn't fit elsewhere|

### Interface ###

A much more pleasant way of viewing this information will 'soon' be available on 
  my github page at [atla5.github.io/](https://github.com/atla5/atla5.github.io)
