    "description":"The way that reseacrh is being conducted is changing in very positive, yet very disruptive ways that Libraries aren't really keeping up with. Numerous open-source tools, alternatives, platforms, and even publishers are rising to fill the gap. What happens to the scholarly record if libraries lose their role in the researcher workflow and publishing lifecycle? Would it actually be better for everyone if it did?",

In so doing, it covers my core design/development philosophy, the centrality of the Principle of Least Power, and the benefits of using the Web Platform, while walking you through the steps of building one yourself.",

Here I present how we've used them at BU Libraries at the small scale.",
