       I was afforded the opportunity to work on multiple projects using the
       SCRUM methodology and the informal code reviews, and to learn AWS and
       C#/Visual Studio on the job. It also provided me with additional
       firsthand experience of the importance of high code quality and of
       documentation.

       I'm particularly proud of and thankful for the work I did on the C#
       project I worked on. The user 'join' and 'filter' systems I designed and
       developed were well-designed and extensible, and the final product my
       teammate and I developed was very polished."
