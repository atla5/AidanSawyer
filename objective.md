## Objective ##

I’m currently looking for a **6-12 month internship** in Software Engineering
from the period of January - December 2017 offering meaningful work involved
with the organization, preservation, and expansion of knowledge, with particular
regard to library, archive, and museum resources and scientific research.

## Purpose ##

There is a **machine** of knowledge discovery, management, and preservation that
powers the intellectual pursuit and expansion of mankind and, in cascading
effect, his productive capacity for and overall output of value.

The **fuel** for this machine, in large part, is the tremendous amount of
information both created on a daily basis at awesome speeds and available in
unprecedented volume and ease.

I intend to spend my career improving this engine and refining this fuel by
working on the software used in and around its central institutions, and on the
tools and schemas with which their content is packaged and described, to the
ultimate goal of **accelerating human progress** exponentially.  

## Implementation ##

I’m currently putting this goal into action by:
- pursuing an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering (from RIT),
- working in the Digital Initiatives department of my university’s library (Wallace)
- developing Free and Open Source Software on github (atla5).
